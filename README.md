# kmel_db_ui

A UI for the parser and generator for Kenwood Music Editor Light databases created by [Chris Willoughby](https://github.com/chrrrisw).
I have actually forked it [here](https://github.com/vsvyatski/kmel_db) and added some improvements.
The UI is based on [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro). Currently this program is meant to
be used on Linux.

## Requirements
They are the same as for kmel_db plus PyQt5.
